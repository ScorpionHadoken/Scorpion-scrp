# Scorpion-scrp
A coding language I made, the file extensions you can use are .scrp or .txt

# Does this actually work?
I hope it does because all it does is show 4 blank lines for me...

# What can I do with .scrp and .txt?

.scrp is meant for using Scorpion anywhere, what I mean by this is I set .scrp files to always open with Scorpion instead of notepad so I can put .scrp files on my desktop instead of in the same directory of Scorpion and not have to use 'Open with...' when opening txt files in notepad and vice versa.
